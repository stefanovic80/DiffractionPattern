This code plots the diffraction pattern of three visible electromagnetic radiations having three different wavelengths, which are purple (400 nm), green (530 nm) and red (800 nm). 
After this, for each of the three wavelengths, a plots of a two slit diffraction pattern is provided. The aim of the job is to show how light undergoes non-rectilinear path when it encounters an obstacle. Furthermore, the code shows how different values of wavelength may affect the inter spacing between different diffraction spots. 
It can be seen that the higher the wavelengths the broader the diffraction pattern.
