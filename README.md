# DiffractionPattern
The code plots the diffraction pattern of three visible electromagnetic radiation having three different wavelength, which are purple (400 nm), green (530 nm) and red (800 nm).
After this, for each of the three wavelengths, a plots of a two slit diffraction pattern is provided. The aim of the job is to show how light undergoes non-rectilinear path when it encounters an obstacle. Furthermore, the code shows how different values of wavelength may the interspacing of main diffraction spots. 
Particularly, higher wavelengths will result in a broadened diffraction pattern as compared to lower ones.
