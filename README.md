# DiffractionPattern
The code plots the diffraction pattern of three visible electromagnetic radiation having three different wavelength, which are purple, green and red.
After this, three plots of a two slit different pattern for each wavelength are provided. The aim of the job is to show how light undergoes non-rectilinear path when it encounters an obstacle. Furthermore, the code show how the different wavelength may affect this phenomena. 
Particularly, higher wavelengths will result in a broadened diffraction pattern as compared to lower ones.
