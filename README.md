# DiffractionPattern
The code plots the diffraction pattern of three visible electromagnetic radiation having three different wavelength, which are purple, green and red.
After this, ror each of the three wavelengths, three plots of a two slit diffraction pattern are provided. The aim of the job is to show how light undergoes non-rectilinear path when it encounters an obstacle. Furthermore, the code shows how different values of wavelength may the interspacing of main diffraction spots. 
Particularly, higher wavelengths will result in a broadened diffraction pattern as compared to lower ones.
